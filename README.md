- **Zoom**: Apply random zooming.
- **Horizontal Flip**: Flip images horizontally.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Vary image brightness.

### 🧠 Advanced Techniques
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adjust the learning rate dynamically during training.
- **Regularization**: Apply techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters to find the optimal settings.

### 🧪 Experimentation
- **Try Different Optimizers**: Experiment with optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, or SGD.
- **Increase Model Depth**: Add more layers or units to the model.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use other pretrained models like ResNet or Inception.

Implementing these techniques can help push the model's performance even further.
